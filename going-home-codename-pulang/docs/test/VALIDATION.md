# Validation record

## M3 narrative update · 2026-09-23

Godot **4.7.2.stable.official.ed1daf0bf**, Compatibility, Windows / NVIDIA RTX 3050 Laptop GPU for the rendered check.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Final combined headless suites, fixed 30 render cadence | **93 Story + 34 Practice + 44 Input + 58 Narrative = 229 checks, 0 failures** |
| Native Narrative with `-StoryDebug -Visual -FixedFps 30` | **61 checks, 0 failures** |
| Delayed queue and locks | Repeated flags do not reset delay; cutscene/dialogue/fade/pause block delivery; busy toast slot defers notices; one banner at a time |
| Save/reload | Remaining delay, delivered order, shown/read/replied state persist; legacy read/replied v1 messages migrate without repeat banners; malformed phone state rejected |
| Save failure | Invalid snapshot intentionally rejects a quiet save; notice stays queued and retries successfully after state is valid |
| Integrated encounter | Shelter → delayed Dad message → reply → guesthouse → journal → reload preserves chapter, phone and reflection |
| Viewer | Disabled on ordinary startup; explicit debug opt-in enables filter/refresh; snapshot and journey file remain unchanged |
| Native render inspection | Banner, unread badge, scrollable inbox and debug panel inspected at 1280×720; badge expansion no longer pushes pause outside viewport |
| Human narrative review / real browser / physical Android | **Pending**; use [M3 guide](M3_PLAYTEST.md) and existing platform checklist |

Reproduce with `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/test.ps1 -Suite All -FixedFps 30`, then `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/test.ps1 -Suite Narrative -StoryDebug -Visual -FixedFps 30`. Narrative has three additional checks when the viewer is enabled. Native screenshots are ignored artifacts in `tests/screenshots/narrative_*.png`; the rendered run log is preserved locally as `.godot-test/NarrativeTests-native30.log`.

The final run has no game parser/runtime errors. The existing sandbox certificate-store startup message remains. Headless fixed cadence is not an FPS performance measurement. Release-build gating is implemented using `OS.is_debug_build()` but a real release export remains untested without matching templates.

## M2 input update · 2026-09-23

Godot **4.7.2.stable.official.ed1daf0bf**, Compatibility renderer, Windows. This delivery adds basic keyboard remapping and touch/safe-area improvements; it does not close platform acceptance.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Headless story / practice / input suites at fixed 60 and 30 render cadences | **93 + 34 + 44 = 171 checks, 0 failures** per combined run |
| Native rendered input suite | **44 checks, 0 failures**; Controls menu and wide touch layout inspected |
| Physical key remapping | Captures while paused; conflict/modifier rejection; Escape cancel; reset; old key stops driving, replacement drives shared controller |
| Persistence and invalid input settings | Settings reload/new-journey preservation; unknown actions, invalid types and reserved keys safely ignored; journey file unchanged |
| Synthetic multitouch events | Simultaneous steering/throttle; independent finger release; drag out/reentry; hidden-menu rejection; background/focus cleanup |
| Simulated safe rectangles | 1280×720, 1600×720, 1280×960 with cutout insets; root bounds, nonoverlapping controls and interaction placement checked |
| Browser iframe and physical Android | **Pending**; use [M2 checklist](M2_PLAYTEST.md) after installing/configuring matching export templates |

Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/test.ps1 -Suite Input -Visual` for the focused rendered suite. `-Suite All` now includes Input alongside Story and Practice, sequentially in isolated storage. Key preferences are restored to defaults when the input test ends.

Synthetic touch events are injected in window pixels and converted by Godot's viewport stretch transform; the first test draft used logical coordinates and was corrected before the successful runs. The Android display-safe-area API branch still needs a real device: desktop inset simulation validates layout math, not the platform's reported cutout rectangle or physical button ergonomics. One initial native shutdown reported resource-lifetime warnings; a verbose repeat exited cleanly without reproducing them. The existing sandbox certificate-store startup message remains as documented below.

## M1 update · 2026-09-23

Same Godot 4.7.2 build and native hardware as the initial record below. The new practice suite drives the complete route under physics rather than teleporting past bends, grades, or bumps.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Story regression suite, fixed render cadence at 60 and 30 | **93 checks, 0 failures** per run |
| Practice suite, fixed render cadence at 60 and 30 | **34 checks, 0 failures** per run |
| Native practice suite with actual 30 FPS cap | **34 checks, 0 failures** |
| Combined headless suites | **127 checks, 0 failures** |
| Complete assisted practice-road traversal | No automatic recovery; maximum lateral distance from road center **3.006 m** on a road with 5 m half-width; maximum bike/road height difference **0.057 m** |
| Reduced-motion camera through full track | Zero camera roll |
| Practice/story isolation | Story snapshot and journey file unchanged; title → practice → title scene replacement verified |
| Render inspection at 1280×720 | Practice entry, cockpit, tight curve, shelter, sections, settings, rain/touch overlay inspected |
| Updated PCK export and packed practice-scene boot | Pass; 475,276-byte resource pack, practice JSON/scripts/scene included, headless scene boot exits 0 after 120 frames |
| Human 5/15-minute comfort sessions | **Pending**; use [M1 playtest guide](M1_PLAYTEST.md) |
| Real browser and physical Android | **Pending**; matching export templates remain unavailable |

Additional regressions cover an intentional solid-barrier collision, stopping without tunneling or false cruising speed, left-lane recovery, recovery after a fall, assist disabled, bounded camera lean, pause/time exclusion, throttle cleanup, weather/ambience switching, and local report serialization. Section jumps are excluded from distance; reports never replace story saves. Only the automatic full-track segment has zero recoveries; the later test deliberately exercises recovery twice.

The test helper now supports `-Suite Story|Practice|All`, `-FixedFps 30|60`, and `-Visual`. It rejects script errors and missing success summaries even when Godot exits zero. Scene-navigation tests await completed scene replacement rather than assuming a fixed number of physics ticks is sufficient at 30 FPS.

Headless `--fixed-fps` is a simulation-cadence check, not measured rendering performance. The native test uses `Engine.max_fps = 30`, keeps physics at 60 Hz, and captures actual rendered output. Neither is a physical Android benchmark or human comfort assessment.

## Initial slice · 2026-09-22

Date: 2026-09-22. Engine: **4.7.2.stable.official.ed1daf0bf**. Renderer: Compatibility / OpenGL 3.3. Native visual test hardware: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU on Windows.

## Executed

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Headless editor import | Pass; no GDScript parser errors or missing game assets |
| Automated suite | **93 checks, 0 failures** |
| Native rendered integration run | **93 checks, 0 failures**; complete Jakarta-to-Karawang flow |
| Viewport inspection | 1280×720 and 1280×600; menu, cinematic, cockpit, dialogue, phone, map, journal, completion screenshots |
| PCK resource export with Web preset | Pass; JSON, scenes, scripts and audio included; tests/tools excluded |
| Boot exported PCK from outside project directory | Pass; engine exits 0 after 120 frames without missing game resources |
| Complete Web export | Blocked: missing `web_nothreads_debug.zip` / `web_nothreads_release.zip` for 4.7.2 |
| Android Debug export | Blocked: missing 4.7.2 `android_debug.apk` / `android_release.apk`; SDK build tools also need updating/configuration |
| Browser, itch.io iframe, physical Android | Not tested |
| Human comfort, final sound mix, narrative pacing | Not accepted; requires human playtesting |

The isolated Windows tool environment logs `Failed to read the root certificate store` at engine startup. The offline game and tests continue normally. This is not counted as a game parser/runtime error. No browser/network success is inferred from these runs.

Headless validation intentionally does not start audible audio streams; rendered runs exercise audio initialization and shutdown. An initial dummy-mixer shutdown resource warning was addressed by keeping headless validation audio-free.

## Test coverage

- Every dialogue start/next/choice target exists; condition checks accept/reject the correct flags.
- Fresh save, replacement save, backup, malformed schema, unknown future schema, missing phone data, malformed journal entry, corruption recovery.
- New Game → opening skip → commute, throttle physically moves the bike, brake stops it, left steer changes heading, ground contact on grade.
- Pause blocks movement; opening/office/departure skip restores deterministic state and control.
- Layoff and mother's call maintain canonical flags, including the quiet reply branch.
- Fuel, scenic engine-off, rain, shelter conversation, phone pause, multitouch steering+throttle, touch release.
- Guesthouse → reflection → save → return to title → Continue restores completion and journal.

The integration test uses direct checkpoint placement between some encounters to keep regressions quick. It is not a substitute for riding every meter, testing every branch interactively, or human 15-minute comfort sessions.

## Reproduce safely

Run `tools/test.ps1` or `tools/test.ps1 -Visual` from PowerShell. The helper imports first, isolates APPDATA to `.godot-test`, and restores the environment afterward. Never launch the corruption tests against a real player's save folder.

The initial delivered PCK is `export/web/pulang.pck` (ignored build artifact, approximately 446 KiB). It is a Godot resource pack, **not** a playable HTML5 distribution. Rebuild after editing using `--export-pack Web export/web/pulang.pck`.

## Required platform gate

- Install matching export templates; Web page launch and audio activation from a genuine user gesture.
- Chrome, Firefox, Edge, embedded/fullscreen keyboard focus, browser reload, storage persistence.
- Two physical Android performance classes, touch control at different aspect ratios, safe area, app suspend/resume, kill/relaunch.
- Low/Medium/High real-export profiling, 30 FPS feel, 15-minute comfort tests, thermal behavior.
- Final art/cutscene/narrative review before M5 acceptance or mass chapter authoring.
